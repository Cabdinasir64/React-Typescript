Welcome to my **React + Vite + TypeScript learning project**!  
This repository is dedicated to exploring how **React and Vite work together with TypeScript**, helping me build type-safe, fast, and modern web applications.

---
## About
This project is a **hands-on learning repository** where I practice building React apps using **Vite** for fast development and **TypeScript** for type safety.  
It demonstrates how modern frontend tools can work together efficiently.

## Learning Goals
- Understand **React functional components** with TypeScript.  
- Learn **props and state typing** in TypeScript.  
- Explore **Vite configuration and fast bundling**.  
- Build scalable and maintainable frontend code.  
- Combine **TypeScript with React hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.).
